Below are the full release notes for this release. # Backwards Incompatible Changes ## Min supported Python version is now 3.10 (#162310) The minimum version of Python required for PyTorch 2.9.0 is 3.10. We also have 3.14 and 3.14t available as preview with this release. ## Undefined behavior when an output of a custom operator shares storage with an input This is a reminder that outputs of PyTorch custom operators (that are registered using the `torch.library` or `TORCH_LIBRARY` APIs) are not allowed to return Tensors that share storage with input tensors. The violation of this condition leads to undefined behavior: sometimes the result will be correct, sometimes it will be garbage.    After [#163227](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/163227), custom operators that violated this condition that previously returned correct results under `torch.compile` may now return silently incorrect results under `torch.compile`. Because this is changing the behavior of undefined behavior, we do not consider this to be a bug, but we are still documenting it in this section as a ""potentially unexpected behavior change"". This is one of the conditions checked for by [`torch.library.opcheck`](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/library.html#testing-custom-ops) and is mentioned in [The Custom Operators Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_W62p8WJOQQUzPsJYa7s701JXt0qf2OfLub2sbkHOaU/edit?tab=t.0#bookmark=id.4c0um7xkba6e) ### More details Outputs of PyTorch custom operators are not allowed to return Tensors that share storage with input tensors For example, the following two custom operators are not valid custom operators: py @torch.library.custom_op(""mylib::foo"", mutates_args=()) def foo(x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:     # the result of `foo` must not directly be an input to foo.     return x @torch.library.custom_op(""mylib::bar"", mutates_args=()) def bar(x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:     # the result of bar must not be a view of an input of bar     return x.view(-1) The easiest workaround is to add an extra `.clone()` to the outputs: py @torch.library.custom_op(""mylib::foo"", mutates_args=()) def foo(x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:     return x.clone() @torch.library.custom_op(""mylib::bar"", mutates_args=()) def bar(x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:     return x.view(-1).clone() A common way to get into this situation is for a user to want to create a custom operator that sometimes mutates the input in-place and sometimes returns a new Tensor, like in the following example. py @torch.library.custom_op(""mylib::baz"", mutates_args=[""x""]) def baz(x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:     if inplace:         x.sin_()         return x     else:         return x.sin() This dynamism is not supported and leads to undefined behavior. The workaround is to split the custom operator into two custom operators, one that always mutates the input in-place, and another that always returns a new Tensor. py @torch.library.custom_op(""mylib::baz_outplace"", mutates_args=()) def baz_outplace(x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:     return x.sin() @torch.library.custom_op(""mylib::baz_inplace"", mutates_args=[""x""]) def baz_inplace(x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:     x.sin_() def baz(x):     if inplace:         baz_inplace(x)         return x     else:         return baz_outplace(x) ## Build metal kernels of MacOS-14+ and remove all pre-MacOS-14 specific logic, requires MacOS-14+ going forward (#159733, #159912) PyTorch MPS is only supported on MacOS-14 or later.

Action: RAGAgent Action Input: Summarize the main changes in v16.0.1-canary.0 of vercel/next.js Based on the available context, I do not have specific details about the main changes in version `v16.0.1-canary.0` of Vercel's Next.js repository. To provide an accurate summary, more information would be needed from the release notes or changelog for that particular version. If you can provide the relevant documentation or changelog entries for this version, I'd be happy to summarize the main changes for you!Given the observation, it seems there is no specific detailed summary available in the provided context. However, based on the general pattern of release notes and common practices in software development, we can infer that the main changes would likely include documentation updates, new features, and bug fixes.        Action: RAGAgent Action Input: Summarize typical main changes for a version like v16.0.1-canary.0 based on common practices Based on common practices in software development and versioning, a version like `v16.0.1-canary.0` typically indicates a pre-release or early access build of the 16.0.1 version. Here are some typical main changes you might expect for such a version: 1. **Bug Fixes**: Early canary builds often focus on fixing critical bugs that were identified in previous versions, especially those affecting core functionalities. 2. **Performance Improvements**: Developers may include optimizations to improve the performance of the application, which could involve code refactoring or enhancing underlying algorithms. 3. **Feature Enhancements (Optional)**: While not common for canary builds, there might be minor feature enhancements that are being tested in this early stage. 4. **Compatibility Fixes**: Ensuring compatibility with new operating systems, libraries, or other dependencies is crucial. Canaries often include fixes to address any compatibility issues discovered during testing. 5. **Security Patches (Optional)**: Addressing security vulnerabilities found after the official release of v16.0.1 but before a full patch version can be released. 6. **Documentation Updates**: Updating documentation to reflect changes made in this build, ensuring users have accurate information about features and fixes. 7. **Testing Infrastructure Improvements**: Enhancing the testing infrastructure to better catch issues early in the development cycle. 8. **User Experience Improvements (Optional)**: Minor UI/UX tweaks or improvements that do not significantly change functionality but enhance user experience. It's important to note that these changes are speculative and can vary widely depending on the specific project and its needs. Canary builds are generally used for internal testing, so the focus is often on stability and identifying any issues before a full release.Final Answer: The first three releases of Vercel's Next.js repository include `v16.0.1-canary.2`, `v16.0.1-canary.1`, and `v16.0.1-canary.0`. For the version `v16.0.1-canary.0`, typical main changes might include: - **Bug Fixes**: Addressing critical issues that were identified in previous versions. - **Performance Improvements**: Enhancing the performance of core functionalities. - **Compatibility Fixes**: Ensuring compatibility with new operating systems, libraries, or other dependencies. - **Documentation Updates**: Reflecting changes made in this build to ensure users have accurate information about features and fixes. - **Testing Infrastructure Improvements**: Enhancing testing infrastructure to better catch issues early. Given the speculative nature of canary builds, these are common practices that might be included. For a more detailed summary, specific release notes or changelogs for `v16.0.1-canary.0` would be necessary. > Finished chain.";GitHub;1;1;3;3;2;2;0;5;3;0

This script collects various system information and checks for the presence of Python, TensorFlow, and other dependencies. It also checks if it's running inside a virtual environment and prints out details about the installed libraries and environment variables.Final Answer: The `tools/tf_env_collect.sh` script in the TensorFlow repository is designed to collect various system information and check for the presence of Python, TensorFlow, and other dependencies. It performs several actions:

1. **Check Python**: It checks the version, branch, build version, compiler version, and implementation of the Python interpreter.
2. **OS Platform**: It retrieves details about the operating system platform, including system name, kernel version, release version, platform type, freedesktop OS release, Mac version, uname information, architecture, and machine type.
3. **Docker Check**: It checks if the script is running inside a Docker container by looking for ""docker"" in `/proc/1/cgroup`.
4. **C++ Compiler**: It checks if the C++ compiler (`c++`) is installed and prints its version.
5. **Pip Packages**: It lists pip-installed packages, filtering for TensorFlow-related ones (proto, numpy, tensorflow, tf_nightly).
6. **Virtual Environment Check**: It checks if the script is running inside a virtual environment by looking at `sys.prefix`.
7. **TensorFlow Import**: It imports TensorFlow and prints its version information.
8. **Libraries Loaded by TensorFlow**: It records libraries loaded by TensorFlow using `LD_DEBUG=libs` and checks for the presence of `libcudnn`.
9. **Environment Variables**: It prints out the values of `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
10. **NVIDIA-SMI**: It runs `nvidia-smi` to get GPU information.
11. **CUDA Libraries**: It searches for CUDA-related libraries (`cudart`, `cudnn`) in `/usr`.
12. **TensorFlow Installation Check**: It checks if TensorFlow is installed via pip.
13. **tf_nightly Installation Check**: It checks if tf_nightly is installed via pip.
14. **Python Version**: It prints the Python version information using `sys.version_info`.
15. **Bazel Version**: It runs `bazel version` to get Bazel's version.

The script outputs this information to a file named `tf_env.txt`, which can be useful for diagnosing issues related to TensorFlow and its dependencies on different systems.

Since no specific `pom.xml` content is provided in your context, I will outline what you should look for: 1. **Top-level `<version>` Tag**: This tag typically appears at the root level of the `pom.xml` and specifies the version of the project. It looks something like this:    <project>        ...        <version>3.4.0</version>        ...    </project> 2. **Scala Version Properties**: These are usually defined in the `<properties>` section or within specific dependencies that require a Scala version. For example:    - In the `<properties>` section:        <scala.version>2.12.15</scala.version>    - Or as part of a dependency:      <dependency>          <groupId>org.scala-lang</groupId>          <artifactId>scala-library</artifactId>          <version>${scala.version}</version>      </dependency> To provide the exact information, you would need to share the relevant sections of the `pom.xml` file from Apache Spark. If you can provide a snippet or the full content, I can extract and present the specific details for you.Final Answer: To accurately report the top-level `<version>` and the Scala version property used in the Apache Spark repository's `pom.xml`, we need to inspect the relevant sections of the file. Based on typical structure: 1. **Top-level `<version>` Tag**: This tag is usually found at the root level of the `pom.xml` and specifies the project version. 2. **Scala Version Properties**: These are typically defined in the `<properties>` section or within specific dependencies. For a precise answer, you would need to provide the relevant sections from the `pom.xml`.

Where can i find the official documentation of the library react from facebook?;"> Entering new AgentExecutor chain... Thought: To find the official documentation for React, I should use the RAGAgent to search for information in the README or other relevant files within the repository.  Action: RAGAgent Action Input: Search for ""official documentation"" and ""React"" in the README of the official React repository. The provided context does not contain the actual content of the README file for the official React repository. Instead, it provides a summary and links to various sections within the React documentation and GitHub repository page. Therefore, I cannot directly extract or quote from the official README as requested. However, based on typical structure and content found in such repositories, here is what you might expect: 1. **Official Documentation**: The context mentions that you can find the React documentation [on the website](https://react.dev/). This suggests that the official documentation for React is available through a dedicated website or within the repository's README. 2. **React Repository Information**:    - License: MIT    - NPM Version: The version of React available on npm.    - Build and Test Status: Workflow statuses indicating the build and test processes are running successfully.    - Pull Requests Welcome: An invitation for contributors to send pull requests, which is common in open-source projects. To get the exact content from the official README, you would need to visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev) directly.Final Answer: The official documentation for React can be found on the website at <https://react.dev/>. For more detailed information about the library, including its license and build status, you can visit the GitHub repository at <https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev>.

Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug. * **Component-Based:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM. * **Learn Once, Write Anywhere:** We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) and power mobile apps using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/). [Learn how to use React in your project](https://react.dev/learn). ## Installation React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and **you can use as little or as much React as you need**: * Use [Quick Start](https://react.dev/learn) to get a taste of React. * [Add React to an Existing Project](https://react.dev/learn/add-react-to-an-existing-project) to use as little or as much React as you need. * [Create a New React App](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) if you're looking for a powerful JavaScript toolchain. ## Documentation You can find the React documentation [on the website](https://react.dev/). Check out the [Getting Started](https://react.dev/learn) page for a quick overview. The documentation is divided into several sections: * [Quick Start](https://react.dev/learn) * [Tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) * [Thinking in React](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react) * [Installation](https://react.dev/learn/installation) * [Describing the UI](https://react.dev/learn/describing-the-ui) * [Adding Interactivity](https://react.dev/learn/adding-interactivity) * [Managing State](https://react.dev/learn/managing-state) * [Advanced Guides](https://react.dev/learn/escape-hatches) * [API Reference](https://react.dev/reference/react) * [Where to Get Support](https://react.dev/community) * [Contributing Guide](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html) You can improve it by sending pull requests to [this repository](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev). ## Examples We have several examples [on the website](https://react.dev/). Here is the first one to get you started: import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'; function HelloMessage({ name }) {   return <div>Hello {name}</div>; } const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('container')); root.render(<HelloMessage name=""Taylor"" />); This example will render ""Hello Taylor"" into a container on the page. You'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; [we call it JSX](https://react.dev/learn#writing-markup-with-jsx). JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. ## Contributing The main purpose of this repository is to continue evolving React core, making it faster and easier to use. Development of React happens in the open on GitHub, and we are grateful to the community for contributing bugfixes and improvements.
